# Puch AI - WhatsApp Integration MCP Server üöÄ

This repository contains the source code for the **MCP (Multi-Capability Provider) Server**, a powerful backend service designed to bridge **Puch AI** with external services like WhatsApp, web content fetching, and product searching. It acts as a tool hub, allowing the AI to perform complex tasks in the real world.

## ‚ú® Overview

Puch AI is an intelligent assistant capable of automating tasks and retrieving information. This MCP server extends its capabilities by providing a secure, authenticated API endpoint that Puch AI can call to execute specific "tools."

This server enables Puch AI to:

  * üåê **Fetch Web Content**: Scrape and process information from any URL on the internet.
  * üõí **Search for Products**: Perform real-time product searches using Google Shopping to provide users with up-to-date recommendations.
  * üì± **Integrate with WhatsApp**: The server is architected to be the backbone of a full-fledged WhatsApp integration.

-----

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

The server provides a single, powerful API endpoint that accepts requests to run a specific tool with given arguments. The process flow is as follows:

1.  **Puch AI receives a user prompt** (e.g., "Find me a good laptop for under $1000").
2.  **Puch AI determines a tool is needed** (e.g., `search_for_products`).
3.  **Puch AI sends a POST request** to this MCP server's `/mcp/` endpoint, specifying the `tool_name` and `arguments`.
4.  **The MCP Server authenticates the request** using the Bearer Token.
5.  **The server executes the requested tool** (e.g., calls the SerpApi for product results).
6.  **The server formats and returns the result** to Puch AI in a structured JSON format.
7.  **Puch AI uses this information** to formulate a natural language response for the user.

## üîß Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get the MCP server running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

  * **Python 3.11+**
  * **pip** (Python package installer)
  * **Git**

### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Open your terminal and clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alok-ahirrao/Puch-AI-WhatsApp-Integration-MCP-Server.git
    cd Puch-AI-WhatsApp-Integration-MCP-Server
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
    It's best practice to create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

    ```bash
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    Install all the required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Create and Configure the `.env` File**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project. This file will store your secret keys and configuration variables. Copy the following and replace the placeholder values.

    ```env
    # Get your API key from https://serpapi.com/
    SERPAPI_API_KEY=YOUR_SERPAPI_API_KEY

    # Your WhatsApp phone number (e.g., 919876543210)
    MY_NUMBER=YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER

    # A strong, secret token for authenticating API requests
    TOKEN=YOUR_SECURE_BEARER_TOKEN
    ```

5.  **Run the Server**
    Start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn.

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    The server should now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## MCP Server Setup Instructions

Follow the instructions below to set up your MCP server and complete the application process.

1.  **Obtain an application key:**

    Use the provided starter code to spin up a local MCP server. After running `/apply <TWITTER/LINKEDIN REPLY URL>`, you will get an application key.

2.  **Create an MCP server:**

    Now you need to create an MCP server using the starter code given in this gist to submit your resume.

3.  **Connect Puch to your MCP server:**

    Use this command to connect Puch with your MCP server: `/mcp connect <SERVER URL (should be publicly accesible)>/mcp <AUTH TOKEN>`

4.  **Validate the auth token and phone number:**

    Puch will run a validation check against your Auth token (application key) and phone number. Validation requires both the key and your phone number, formatted as {country_code}{number} ‚Äî without the + symbol. Example: 919876543210 for an Indian number.

5.  **Create a resume tool:**

    Feed your resume to Puch: Create a tool that sends your resume in a format fit for an LLM.

    *   Resume Tool Requirement: Your server must include a resume tool that:
        *   Accepts a local file (your resume).
        *   Converts it to markdown text
        *   Submits the data to the Puch AI MCP endpoint as a string.

6.  **Set up an ngrok server:**

    To make your local server publicly accessible, you can use ngrok. Run the following command: `ngrok http 8085`

-----

## üîë Authentication

All requests to the `/mcp/` endpoint must be authenticated using a **Bearer Token**. Include the token in the `Authorization` header of your request.

`Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECURE_BEARER_TOKEN`

Replace `YOUR_SECURE_BEARER_TOKEN` with the value you set for `TOKEN` in your `.env` file. A request with a missing or invalid token will result in a `401 Unauthorized` error.

-----

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Tools

The server exposes its capabilities through a set of tools. You can invoke a tool by sending a POST request to the `/mcp/` endpoint.

### `fetch`
